## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Application won't start** | Ensure you're running as Administrator |
| **Device not found** | Check mouse hardware settings (Vendor ID, Product ID, Interface Number) |
| **Could not send feature report** | Try different Interface Number values (0, 1, 2, etc.) in Settings |
| **Polling rate unchanged** | Verify your mouse model is compatible or adjust hardware settings |
| **Permission denied** | Always run as Administrator - required for HID access |
| **Tray icon missing** | Check Windows notification settings and hidden icons |
| **Games not detected** | Verify exact process names in Task Manager Details tab |
| **Settings not saving** | Ensure application has write access to user data directory |
